# CODSOFT-TASK2
I’m pleased to inform you that I’ve successfully completed my second task—the restaurant menu design—at Codsoft. 
It was a rewarding project, and I’m really happy with how it turned out.
I’m eager to keep the momentum going and contribute further.
If there are any new tasks or additional areas where you think I can be of help, please let me know.
I’m excited about continuing our progress and tackling new challenges!
